# opendlv-python-template

## 2 do for creating a new file:
- change the name of opendlv-template.py to a more discriptive name. Change the name also in the Dockerfile! Or just use refactoring in an IDE that changes it automatically (Tested in PyCharm)
- follow the instructions in the opendlv-template.py file


template:
- easy setting of UDP multicast and shared memory
- fast adaption of needed packages for the docker image
